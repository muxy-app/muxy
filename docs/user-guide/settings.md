# Settings

Open settings with `Cmd+,` (**Muxy -> Settings...**). Use search at the top to find settings by name.

## Worktree path templates

Set the default under **Projects -> Worktrees** and choose **Template**. Every template must include `{branch}` and can
also use these filesystem-safe values:

- `{project-name}` — the project name shown in Muxy
- `{base-dir}` — the current checkout folder name
- `{branch}` — the branch name, with path separators replaced

Relative templates start from the project folder. For a project at `/code/my-app` and branch `feature/auth`,
`../{base-dir}.{branch}` resolves to `/code/my-app.feature-auth`.

Choose **Folder** to retain Muxy's existing folder layout. A global folder stores worktrees under
`<folder>/<project-name>/<worktree-name>`, while a folder selected in the new worktree dialog stores them under
`<folder>/<worktree-name>`. A project-specific template or folder selected in that dialog takes precedence over the
global setting. Remote worktrees keep their remote workspace layout.
